The container supports three reconnection mechanisms: scheduled switching, connection failure handling, and health monitoring.

## Scheduled Reconnection

Use `RECREATE_VPN_CRON` to periodically switch to a different server. This uses standard cron syntax.

```bash
# Reconnect every 6 hours at minute 0
-e RECREATE_VPN_CRON="0 */6 * * *"

# Reconnect daily at 3 AM
-e RECREATE_VPN_CRON="0 3 * * *"

# Reconnect every 4 hours
-e RECREATE_VPN_CRON="0 */4 * * *"
```

When triggered, `vpn-reconnect` selects a new server and prepares the new config **while the current tunnel stays up** — the API calls and load sorting no longer count as downtime. Only then is the interface swapped, so the actual interruption is the `wg-quick` down/up itself (about 1–2 seconds). If server selection fails (for example the API is unreachable), the existing connection is kept untouched.

### Making rotation effective

Server selection always takes the top of the filtered pool (NordVPN's recommended order for a single location, load-sorted for multiple locations). Without further settings a scheduled rotation can therefore re-select the very server you are already on. Set `RANDOM_TOP` so rotation actually lands somewhere new:

```bash
-e RANDOM_TOP=10
```

This shuffles the ten best servers in the pool and picks one — a genuinely different exit IP on almost every rotation, while still staying on low-load recommended servers. Larger values add IP variety but start including higher-load servers; see [Server Selection](Server-Selection) for how the pool is built.

### Choosing a schedule

- **Server hygiene** (avoid sitting on a server that slowly degrades): daily off-peak, e.g. `0 6 * * *`, is plenty. A good default for seedboxes and gateways, since every rotation changes the exit IP and drops long-lived connections (torrent peers re-announce, sessions reset). Note the container runs on UTC unless `TZ` is set.
- **IP rotation for privacy**: every few hours, e.g. `0 */6 * * *` or `0 */4 * * *`. Going below hourly gains little and constantly disturbs anything stateful.
- **Latency-sensitive, single pinned city**: scheduled rotation can be skipped entirely — recommended-order selection already favors the best server at connect time, and health monitoring (below) moves you off a broken one.

## Connection Failure Handling

WireGuard is a connectionless, "silent" protocol — there is no session that errors out when the path dies, so failures don't restart the service on their own. The generated config sets `PersistentKeepalive = 25` to keep NAT mappings alive, but detecting a dead tunnel relies on **health monitoring** (below): when probes fail, `vpn-healthcheck` runs `vpn-reconnect`, which selects a new server and swaps the tunnel.

If you want servers rotated even without failures, combine health monitoring with scheduled reconnection (`RECREATE_VPN_CRON`).

## Connection Health Monitoring

Use the `CHECK_CONNECTION_*` variables for active health probing:

```bash
-e CHECK_CONNECTION_CRON="* * * * *"
-e CHECK_CONNECTION_URL="https://www.gstatic.com/generate_204;https://cp.cloudflare.com/generate_204"
-e CHECK_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS=3
-e CHECK_CONNECTION_ATTEMPT_INTERVAL=5
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CHECK_CONNECTION_CRON` | Disabled | Cron schedule for health checks |
| `CHECK_CONNECTION_URL` | `https://www.google.com` | URLs to probe (semicolon-separated) |
| `CHECK_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS` | `5` | Number of retry attempts |
| `CHECK_CONNECTION_ATTEMPT_INTERVAL` | `10` | Seconds between retries |

A check passes as soon as **any** URL answers with HTTP 2xx/3xx, so listing two URLs on independent infrastructure prevents a single provider's outage (or a geo-block on some exit servers) from triggering a spurious reconnect. The dedicated connectivity endpoints `https://www.gstatic.com/generate_204` and `https://cp.cloudflare.com/generate_204` are ideal: no body, no redirects, and they answer from everywhere.

### Tuning the schedule

Two timings matter:

- **Run length.** A fully failing check runs for about `ATTEMPTS × (2s timeout + ATTEMPT_INTERVAL)` seconds (the interval elapses after the last attempt too). Keep this below the cron period so runs don't overlap — the defaults (5 × ~12s ≈ 60s) are too long for an every-minute cron; pair a `* * * * *` schedule with `ATTEMPTS=3` and `ATTEMPT_INTERVAL=5` (~20s).
- **Worst-case recovery.** Time from outage to reconnect is roughly `cron period + run length` — about 1.5 minutes with an every-minute cron and 3×5s retries.

Don't shrink the retries too far: the retry window should outlast a transient blip (a brief ISP hiccup, a server-side pause). A reconnect is fast (~1–2s of downtime) but changes the exit IP, which resets anything sensitive to it — one failed request should never rotate the server; 15+ seconds of nothing getting through should.

## Docker Health Status

The image ships a Docker [`HEALTHCHECK`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#healthcheck) that reports the container's health (`healthy` / `unhealthy`) to Docker, Compose `depends_on: condition: service_healthy`, Swarm/Kubernetes, and monitoring or autoheal sidecars. It is **observational only** — it never reconnects. Active recovery is handled separately by `CHECK_CONNECTION_*` and `RECREATE_VPN_CRON`.

It is **opt-in**: while disabled (the default) the probe always reports healthy without testing anything. Set `HEALTHCHECK_ENABLED=true` to activate it.

```bash
-e HEALTHCHECK_ENABLED=true
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HEALTHCHECK_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable the Docker `HEALTHCHECK` probe. When disabled, the container always reports healthy. |

When enabled, the probe checks that the `wg0` interface exists and that a single short request to `CHECK_CONNECTION_URL` succeeds. The probe runs every 60s with a 60s start period and 3 retries before the container is marked `unhealthy`; unlike the cron `CHECK_CONNECTION_*` check it performs no retry loop of its own and never triggers a reconnect.

## Recommended Setup

For most users, combining scheduled rotation with health monitoring provides robust connectivity:

```yaml
environment:
  - RECREATE_VPN_CRON=0 6 * * *             # Rotate daily, off-peak (UTC unless TZ is set)
  - RANDOM_TOP=10                           # So rotation lands on a different server
  - CHECK_CONNECTION_CRON=* * * * *         # Probe every minute
  - CHECK_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS=3
  - CHECK_CONNECTION_ATTEMPT_INTERVAL=5
  - CHECK_CONNECTION_URL=https://www.gstatic.com/generate_204;https://cp.cloudflare.com/generate_204
  - HEALTHCHECK_ENABLED=true
```

This detects a dead tunnel and finishes reconnecting within ~1.5 minutes worst case, tolerates short blips without rotating the exit IP, and rotates to a fresh low-load server once a day.

For long-lived connections where an IP change is disruptive (seedbox, remote sessions), lean more conservative: `CHECK_CONNECTION_CRON=*/2 * * * *`, `CHECK_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS=4`, `CHECK_CONNECTION_ATTEMPT_INTERVAL=10` — about 45 seconds of confirmed failure before the server is rotated. If the check cron runs infrequently, pick a rotation minute that doesn't collide with it (e.g. check on `*/5`, rotate at minute 2); with an every-minute check the overlap is harmless — a check landing during the 1–2s swap is absorbed by the retries.
